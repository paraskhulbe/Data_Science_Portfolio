# Data Analytics Projects
These are data analysis projects that I've worked on using Python, utilizing visualization and various statistical analysis techniques to pull insights from data sets.

**Projects**

911 Calls -Capstone Project -- An exploratory analysis of the dataset including descriptions of findings using the Montegomery County 911 Calls dataset available on Kaggle. 

AB Testing Retention Rate for Mobile Games Company -- Used the dataset from an A/B test for a mobile game to determine whether changing a game element to a different level improved user retention. 

Advertising Predictions using Logistic Regression -- Used Logistic Regression to predict whether users would click on an ad based on user data and to understand what are the leading factors to why users click on ads. 

Bank Authentication Classifier with Tensorflow -- Used tensorflow to create a classifier that used image data from the Bank Authentication Data provided by the UCI repository to determine if a bank note was real or not.

Bank Debts Recovery Analysis -- Used Linear Regression, Chi Squared tests, and Kruskal-Wallis statistical test to confirm the validity of different levels of debt recovery strategy spending based on user expected return value.

Choropleth Mapping -- Created geographical maps using plotly

Decision Trees & Random Forest to Predict Borrower Payback -- Created decision tree and random forest models to predict loan payback using Lending Club data. 

Ecommerce Analysis using Linear Regression -- Used Linear Regression to give insight into ecommerce company's decision on whether to focus on their mobile app or website. The data and company are fictional.

Financial Crisis Bank Data - Capstone Project -- An exploratory analysis of stock market data for 6 major banks throughout the 10 year period surrounding the financial crisis. 

K-Means Clustering for Determining Public vs. Private Universities -- Performed K-Means clustering to see how K-Means clustering would categorize public and private universities. 

K Nearest Neighbors For Anonymized Data Set -- Created a K Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict target variable of an anonymized data set. 

Predicting Credit Card Approvals Using Logistic Regression -- Used Logistic Regression to create a model that predicts credit card removal. Utilized Grid Search to tune the model for better performance. 

Predicting Species of Iris Data Set using Support Vector Machines -- Used Support Vector Machines to classify famous Iris dataset.
