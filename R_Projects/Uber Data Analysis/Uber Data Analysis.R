cat("Insights from the Supply Demand gap Analysis:-\n",
    "1) The early morning spike in supply demand gap is contributed mainly by cancellations from the city\n ",
    "2) The Late night spike is contributed mainly due to unavailability of cars at the Airport\n")

#------Part 3- Root Cause Analysis of Supply Demand Gap -------#    

#------Late night Supply Demand Gap-------#
# 1) Late Night Supply Demand Gap is caused due to a huge spike in demand at the Airport
# between 5 PM and 10 PM. There is not Enough organic Supply from the city to cope up with
# this spike in Demand. This may be caused because there are many more Flights landing during
# this time than FLights leaving from the City. However we do not have enough Data to prove this Hypothesis.
# The complete time table of flights to and from the city by day of week can supplement this study.

#-------Early Morning Supply Demand Gap------#
# 2) Early Morning Supply Demand Gap is caused due to a huge spike in demand at the City
# between 5 AM and 10 AM. However during this time there are a large no. of cancellations done by drivers
# which leads to a supply demand gap along with a smaller no. of incidences of "No Cars Available"
# One possible reason for cancellations might be that drivers face large wait times on completing a Trip to the Airport
# due to which they refuse to take up City- Airport trips during Early Morning
# This graph compliments the idea-
p9
# It can be seen that the Demand is quite low for Early Morning trips from the Airport to City, which might lead to long wait times
# for Drivers who arrive at the Airport during this time.
# Let us see if this is true by calculating Wait times for drivers  
uber_data <- uber_data %>% arrange(Driver.id,Request.timestamp)
head(uber_data,10)
# We can see that there are succesive trips from Drivers with Pickup Point as Airport or City
# instead of alternate Airport and City pairs. This might occur because drivers take other trips between
# different points in the city for which data is not available or they might work in shifts 
# and elect to go home after completing a trip rather than do another Trip.
# So calculating Idle/Wait times is not possible with the current dataset 
# without supplying additional information.
# In this scenario we can only hypothesize that the cause for cancellations done by drivers
# is long wait times faced at the Airport.

#------ Part 4- Recommendations to resolve the supply-demand gap -------#
# 1) Providing a small but dedicated fleet of cabs at the airport between evening and late night hours. 
# Since there seems to be a huge demand spike in the No. of Requests at this time,
# having a dedicated fleet of cabs will reduce instances of "No Cars available". 
# In order to divert less cars to the Airport UBER might also look at implementing a share cab feature
# such that travelers don't have to book the entire cab by themselves if they don't want to.
##---------------------------------------------------------------##
# 2) Providing a lump sum compensation to drivers for waiting at the airport during early morning hours
# or providing a portion of the fuel costs. This will encourage drivers not to cancel rides 
# between the city and Airport during the morning time slot (5 to 10 AM)
# during which there are many flights leaving from the city.
##---------------------------------------------------------------##
# There is also a problem of unavailability of cars from the city during early morning (to a lesser degree). 
# It can be alleviated by encouraging more drivers to take up the early morning shift, 
# perhaps by giving them slightly higher compensation.
