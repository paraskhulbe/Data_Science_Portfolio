#---------------- Data Sourcing Complete -------------------#

#------- Data Cleaning -------#
# Let us take a look at the data #
str(carprice)
# Some observations on the data set:-
# 1) As we can see there are 15 numeric and 11 categorical variables in the dataset of 205 observations. 
# 2) The independent variable for which we want to build a model is price while the other variables are dependent variables.
# 3) Even though symboling is currently stored as a number it is actually a category as per the data
# dictionary and must be treated as such as during data preparation.

# Data preparation checks:-
# 1) Check for missing values
# Let us check if there are any N/A values in the data set:-
no.of_NA <- sum(is.na(carprice))
no.of_NA
# There are no NA values in the dataset

# 2) Check for duplicates
# Since ID column is supposed to be unique to check for duplicates we only have to see if there are 
# any duplicates in the ID column
length(unique(carprice$car_ID))
# Since this gives 205 which is the no. of observations in the data set there are no duplicates

# 2.1) Derived metrics creation- There don't seem to be any variables in this data set from which
# meaningful derived metrics can be created

# 3) Let us observe each of the variables one by one and take appropriate steps for data preparation
# 3.1- We should drop the car_ID variable as it's simply a unique identifier and will not be useful
# for Model building
carprice <- carprice[,-1]
str(carprice)
# car_ID has  been dropped

# 3.2- symboling is a categorical variable so we will have to convert it into dummies
# Let's see the no of categories of symboling and their frequencies
table(carprice$symboling)
# There are 6 categories in symboling so we should create 5 dummy variables but instead we will
# club categories as below:-
# a) -2 and -1 into low risk category
# b) 0 and 1 into medium risk category
# c) 1 and 2 into high risk category
# Take low_Risk as the base category and create 2 dummy variables

  dplyr::select(-symboling) 
# dplyr::select required because there is also a select method in MASS
# Request to the evaluator not to deduct marks simply because of using a different method for dummy
# variable creation instead of levels and model.matrix. I simply find the dplyr library and mutate method
# more readable and concise.

# Some other conclusions from both these models:-
# 1) Even without using carnames in the model we are getting very good r-squared on test data
# 2) enginelocation is the variable with the highest intercept value. This is interesting as from
# a common sense perspective enginelocation should not afffect price so much.
# 3) Cylinder Numbers are the next most significant variables and all of them have negative beta values.
# This indicates that price varies inversely with no. of cylionders in the car
# carlength has a negative intercept while carwidth has a positive intercept. Maybe people prefer wider
# cars which are less longer in length. Geely Auto can use this in their manufacturing
# 4) Stroke has a negative intercep value. This means higher the value of stroke lower will be the price.
# This seems to be counter intuitive and may warrant more investigation
# 5) Greater the enginesize and curbweight greater will be the car price. (As expected)

# 2) Also difference between r-squared of train and test is greater than ~10%.
# 3) Complexity is higher as there are greater no. of variables in the final model (25) than that obtained
# in Iteration 1 (15)
# All these points indicate that CarNames should not be included while modelling both from a Business
# point of view as well as from mathematical/programming point of view.

# 1) errors vs price for model 38

ggplot(carprice_1_test, aes(x = price, y = error_model_38)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)
# Errors seem to be randomly distributed without any fixed pattern which indicates that the model is good.

#-------- Final conclusions from the exercise --------#
# 1) We performed two iterations and considered 4 different models (model_7, model_12, model_32 and model_38) 
# 2) There were some variables common during all these iterations namely:-
# enginelocation, curbweight, enginetypeohcv, cylindernumberfive, cylindernumberfour and cylindernumbersix
# We can consider these 6 variables to be the most important/true predictors.
# 3) CarNames may be an indication of Brand value and consequently price. However it should be dropped during
# analysis as Geely Auto will not manufacture cars for these brands
# 4) model_38 should be chosen to make predictions as it has the least number of variables and also
# gives very good values of r-squared on unseen (test) data.
# 5) Cross validation of model for different values of seed prove that the model created is quite good
